Set htdocs as the root directory for this project.
All calls are handled by the index.php file within htdocs.

To clear all games and votes run clearall.php from the command line.

Dependencies:
    PHPUnit 3.6.8 (to run tests)

Note on framework:
    typically I wouldn't make my own framework and would prefer to
    use something such as codeigniter for the typical reasons (more
    secure, better test coverage, ongoing support etc). However,
    the instructions do not specify whether or not a third-party 
    framework should be used, so I made my own.
